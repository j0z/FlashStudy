A flashcard app for Windows 8

The flashcard apps in the Windows Store suck, so I set out to make my own.
I like stuff, you like free stuff, so this app will be free when released!

Current Version:
* It Works!
* Basic add/move/flip/restudy functions. Everything you need to use the app.
* Saving/loading of cards

TODO:
* Multiple stacks of cards
* Snap view
* Meeting Windows Store Guidelines for saving/resuming/etc.
* New view to show card stacks
* State saving
